# CorruptMNIST Classifier

This project is a simple image classifier for a slightly modified mnist dataset using Python and the PyTorch library.
The purpose of the project is to learn and practice tools relating to MLOPs in accordance with DTUs machine learning operations course (https://skaftenicki.github.io/dtu_mlops/)

## Tools, skills, and principles learned include:
Reproducability
- virtual environment management with uv
- system-level reproducability with Docker and Dev Containers
- data versioning with DVC (and it's Google Cloud extension)

Continuous Integration
- Github Actions
- Pre-commit

Cloud
- Docker image build and storage with GCP Artifact Registry
- training with GCP Vertex AI
- model deployment with Cloud Functions

Monitoring
